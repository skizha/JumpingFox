# Rate Limiting Configuration Cleanup

## Files Removed

The following rate limiting configuration files and policy application scripts have been removed:

### Policy Files:
- `apim-policy-overall.xml` - Overall API rate limit policy (10,000 req/min)
- `apim-policy-create-fox.xml` - Create Fox operation rate limit policy (5 req/min per IP)
- `ip-rate-limit.xml` - IP-based rate limiting policy

### Application Scripts:
- `apply-rate-limit.ps1` - Original rate limit application script
- `apply-updated-rate-limits.ps1` - Updated rate limit application script
- `apply-rate-limits-simple.ps1` - Simplified rate limit application script
- `apply-fixed-policies.ps1` - Fixed policy application script

### Documentation:
- `MANUAL-POLICY-UPDATE.md` - Manual policy update instructions

## Files Retained

The following testing scripts are preserved for future use:

### Testing Scripts:
- `scripts/testing/test-rate-limit.ps1` - Basic rate limit testing
- `scripts/testing/test-apim-rate-limits.ps1` - Comprehensive APIM rate limit testing
- `scripts/testing/test-create-fox-rate-limit.ps1` - Create Fox specific rate limit testing

## Next Steps

Rate limiting can be configured later by:

1. **Creating new policy files** in the Azure Portal or using Azure CLI
2. **Applying policies manually** through the Azure Portal APIM interface
3. **Using the existing test scripts** to validate rate limiting behavior
4. **Referencing the policy examples** in README.md for common patterns

The testing infrastructure remains intact and ready for use once rate limiting policies are configured separately.
